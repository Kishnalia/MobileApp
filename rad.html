        <h1>Rapid Application Development</h1>
        <p>RAD means an adaptive software development model based on
            prototyping and quick feedback with less emphasis on specific
            planning. In general, the RAD approach prioritizes development
            and building a prototype, rather than planning. With rapid
            application development, developers can quickly make multiple
            iterations and updates to the software without starting from
            scratch. This helps ensure that the final outcome is more
            quality-focused and aligns with the end users’ requirements</p>

                <h3>REQUIREMENTS & PLANNING</h3>
                <p>This phase is equivalent to a project scoping meeting. Although
                    the planning phase is condensed compared to other project
                    management methodologies, this is a critical step for the
                    ultimate success of the project</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>USER DESIGN</h3>
                <p>During this phase, clients work hand in hand with developers to ensure their
                    needs are being met at every step in the design process. It’s almost like
                    customizable software development where the users can test each
                    prototype of the product, at each stage, to ensure it meets their
                    expectations.</p>

                <h3>RAPID CONSTRUCTION
                </h3>
                <p>Because the majority of the problems and changes were addressed
                    during the thorough iterative design phase, developers can construct
                    the final working model more quickly than they could by following a
                    traditional project management approach.</p>

                <p>This is the implementation phase where the finished product goes to
                    launch. It includes data conversion, testing, and changeover to the new
                    system, as well as user training.
                    All final changes are made while the coders and clients continue to look for
                    bugs in the system.

                <ul>
                    <li>RAD lets you break the project down into smaller, more
                        manageable tasks.</li>
                    <li>The task-oriented structure allows project managers to
                        optimize their team’s efficiency by assigning tasks according to
                        members’ specialties and experience.</li>
                    <li>Clients get a working product delivered in a shorter time frame.</li>
